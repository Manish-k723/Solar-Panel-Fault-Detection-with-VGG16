# Solar Panel Fault Detection System
### Overview
The Solar Panel Fault Detection System is a project designed to automatically detect and classify faults in solar panels based on images captured by cameras installed in solar farms. The system utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze images and identify common faults such as cracks, hotspots, soiling, shading, and other anomalies that may affect the performance of solar panels. By automatically detecting and classifying faults, the system aims to improve the maintenance and efficiency of solar panel installations, ultimately leading to increased energy generation and cost savings.

### Installation
To run the Solar Panel Fault Detection System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-panel-fault-detection.git`

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   
`cd solar-panel-fault-detection`

5. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
To use the Solar Panel Fault Detection System, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have access to images captured by cameras installed in solar farms.
2. Run the main script to analyze the images and detect faults:
`python main.py`
3. The system will process the images and generate reports indicating the presence of faults, their types, and locations.
